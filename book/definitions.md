# Definitions used in this ATBD

Here follows a glossary, or list of definitions

```{glossary}

Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
    The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity is a Satellite based L-Band Radiometer launched by ESA in 2009.

Soil Moisture Active/Passive
    The Soil Moisture Active/Passive is a Satellite based L-Band Radiometer launched by NASA in 2015.

Sea Ice Concentration
    The Sea Ice Concentration is the fraction of the sea surface covered by sea ice. It is a measure of the amount of sea ice in a given area. It is usually expressed as a percentage.

Sea Ice Thickness
    The Sea Ice Thickness is the thickness of the sea ice. It is usually expressed in meters.

Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer
    The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer is a Microwave Radiometer which launch is planned by ESA in 2028.

Brightness Temperature
    The Brightness Temperature is the temperature of a surface as seen by a passive microwave sensor. It is a measure of the amount of energy emitted by a surface. It is usually expressed in Kelvin.

Top of Atmosphere
    The Top of Atmosphere means the top of the atmosphere. The term is used in the context of the brightness temperature meausre to indicate that the atmospheric influence is part of the measurement. This term also includes the influence of the ionosphere, see {term}`Total Electron Content`.

Total Electron Content
    The Total Electron Content is the total number of electrons per unit volume in the path between the satellite and the earth. It is usually expressed in electrons per square meter. Higher TEC values lead to higher rotation of the polarization plane of the microwave radiation.
